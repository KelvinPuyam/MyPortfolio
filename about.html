			<p align="center">Hello! My name is Kelvin Puyam, I'm 20 years old and I'm a native Gujrati. I have several years of experience coding Front-End and Back-End using different languages, such as HTML/CSS, C#, C++ and Java. I gathered interest in programming when I began high school. I was on the Computer Science track, which meant I was taking programming courses daily through the period I was enrolled. During the three years I was a high school student, I've learned App Inventor for Andriod, C# and Java, documenting my weekly assignments each semester on Google Sites. I wasn't sure what I could do with a career with Computer Science at the time, but I knew I was excited to see something I created in real time. I was eager to learn new concepts and develop more dynamic projects with these new technologies. I was encouraged to seek out Hackathons during my starting years by my programming teacher, and I was able to experience a lot of new things. From there on, I knew I wanted to pursue Computer Programming professionally.
			<br><br>I'm currently attending SRM University, obtaining a B.Tech degree in Computer Science. Hopefully, in the next couple of years, I'll be in an Engineering or Game Dev role where I'm passionate about my projects and use my platform to inspire young students and underrepresented minorities like myself to study CSE subjects.</p>
